Here’s an updated **README.md** for your **"vox-resume-bot-ui"** project. I’ve tailored it to reflect your voice-to-resume Micro SaaS, kept the Next.js and TypeScript details, and made it more specific to your goals. It’s concise, developer-friendly, and sets clear expectations.

# vox-resume-bot-ui

A frontend for an AI-powered resume builder that turns your voice into a professional resume, delivered via WhatsApp or email. Built with Next.js and TypeScript for a fast, type-safe UI.

## Overview

This is the UI layer of a Micro SaaS project where users speak their work experience, skills, and preferences to generate a resume. The frontend captures voice input and previews the resume, with plans to integrate with a backend for AI processing and delivery via WhatsApp/email.

- **Tech Stack**: Next.js, TypeScript  
- **Features**: Voice input interface, resume preview  
- **Status**: In development—focused on UI and voice capture  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or later)  
- npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun  

### Installation
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/vox-resume-bot-ui.git
   cd vox-resume-bot-ui
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   # or
   bun install
   ```

### Running the Development Server
Start the app locally:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app. Edit `pages/index.tsx` to modify the main page—changes auto-update via hot reloading.

## Project Structure
- `pages/index.tsx`: Main UI for voice input and resume preview  
- `pages/api/*`: API routes (e.g., `hello.ts` for testing)  
- `public/`: Static assets  

API routes are available at [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello) for now—edit `pages/api/hello.ts` to customize.

## Next Steps
- Add voice recognition (e.g., `react-speech-recognition` or browser Speech API)  
- Integrate with `vox-resume-bot-api` (backend TBD) for resume generation and delivery  
- Style with [Tailwind CSS, Chakra UI, etc.—add your choice if applicable]

### What I Fixed:
1. **Purpose**: Replaced the generic Next.js boilerplate intro with your project’s specific goal and features.  
2. **Clarity**: Added an "Overview" section to explain what this repo does and its current state.  
3. **Structure**: Kept the useful Next.js setup instructions but trimmed fluff (e.g., Geist font mention unless you’re using it).  
4. **Customization**: Left placeholders for libraries (e.g., voice or styling) you might add—update those as you go.  
5. **Tone**: Made it engaging for devs while keeping it professional.

### Notes:
- If you’ve already added specific tools (e.g., Tailwind, a voice library), let me know, and I’ll weave them in.  
- If you want a badge (e.g., `![Next.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Next.js-black)`), I can add that flair.  

How’s this look? Anything you’d like to tweak further?
